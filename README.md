Microsoft Excel Data Analysis and Visualization
This project is from a bike retail company. The company collected 13 variables about customers who visited the store to inquire or purchase bikes. The variables are;
1.	Unique customer identifier (ID)
2.	Gender
3.	Marital status
4.	Income
5.	Children
6.	Education
7.	Occupation
8.	Homeownership
9.	Cars owned
10.	Commute distance
11.	Region
12.	Age
13.	Whether the customer purchased a bike or not
Step 1: Step 1 was creating analysis tabs as follows;
1.	A working sheet to create a copy of the data. This ensures that should anything happen during the analysis process, one can refer to the original data that is untouched.
2.	The pivot tables
3.	The dashboard for visualization
Step 2: Data Cleaning
1.	The first step is checking if there are any duplicates and removing them. Duplicates are identified using ID that is unique for each customer.
2.	The column for marital status and gender have initials. While in obvious cases like these ones it is easy for anyone to guess and correctly get what the initials mean, in some other data types it may not be the case. Hence, we need to convert these initials into full names using the column-find-replace method.
3.	I did a scan using filter tabs to check if there is data that should be cleaned. 
4.	Age was given as integers, giving a wide range; bundling age into groups would make the data easy for analysis and visualization.
5.	I create divided age ranges to adolescents, middle-aged persons, and senior persons.
Step 3: Created Pivot Tables
1.	I created Pivot tables and charts. The first table concerns gender and income distribution among those who purchased and those who did not purchase bikes.
2.	I also checked the distance commuted for each customer and the number of bikes purchased.
Step 4: Created a Dashboard
1.	I created a dynamic table with visualizations using slicers and other Ms Excel features.
This Project demonstrates that I understand Microsoft Excel Data Analysis and Visualization very well. I can do more than what I have demonstrated here depending on business needs.
